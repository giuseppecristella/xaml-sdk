This example aims to demonstrate the data binding feature of RadHeatMap. You can bind the RadHeatMap to any source that implements one of the following interfaces:

  - IEnumerable - supports simple iteration of a collection. See the MSDN article for more on IEnumerable.
  - ICollection - extends IEnumerable and supports size, enumerator, and synchronization methods for collections.
  - IList - extends ICollection and is the base class for lists.
