You can use the MapNavigation control outside the RadMap control. In order to associate the external MapNavigation control and the RadMap instance, set the MapControl property of MapNavigation to the respective RadMap instance.
You can configure the RadMap control not to show its default MapNavigation control using its NavigationVisibility property or the UseDefaultLayout property that disables the default layout of RadMap.
