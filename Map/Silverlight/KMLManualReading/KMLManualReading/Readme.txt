The RadMap provides support for stunning map overlays through its KML-import feature. Once you have the desired set of features (place marks, images, polygons, textual descriptions, etc.) encoded in KML, you can easily import the data and visualize it through the RadMap control. In this way you can easily visualize complex shapes like country's borders on the map and fill the separate shapes with different colors in order to achieve a sort of grouping.
The RadMap allows you to manually read the file, by which you are able to get the shapes collection, without to automatically insert it into the layer. For this purpose you have to use the KMLReader static class.
