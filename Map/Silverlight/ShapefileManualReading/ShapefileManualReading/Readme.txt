The ESRI Shapefiles or simply the shapefiles are popular format for storing geographical data. The files spatially describe geometries like lines, polylines and polygons. These geometries may represent different geographical objects such as countries, roads, rivers, lakes etc. Via a software that supports the format, the geometries can be translated properly on a map.
The RadMap allows you to manually read the file, by which you are able to get the shapes collection, without to automatically insert it into the layer. For this purpose you have to use the ShapeFileReader static class.
