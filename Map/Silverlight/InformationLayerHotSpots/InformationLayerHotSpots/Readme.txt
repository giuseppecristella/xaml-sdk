Normally the elements placed in the Information Layer get positioned via Location coordinates. In this way their top-left corner will coincide with the point representing the location. When using FrameworkElements in your InformationLayer you can additionally arrange them around the point via their HorizontalAlignment and VerticalAlignment properties.
To adjust the position of the element via the HotSpot you have to set its X and Y properties. Their value can be measured in different units. To choose the desired unit you have to set the XUnits and YUnits properties.
