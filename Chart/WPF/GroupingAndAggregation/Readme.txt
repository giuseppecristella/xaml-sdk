RadChart supports grouping and aggregation. Which means that you can group the underlying data and apply one of the supported aggregation functions. This is a very powerful way to build charts that let you summarize business data in seconds.

Grouping is a process which groups the data by one or more parameters. RadChart allows you to create charts showing the data grouped by one or more criteria. Using the specified criteria, RadChart will first process and group the data and second, will create as many series as needed in order to visualize the groups properly.
