When using the standard ChartGroupDescriptor, it is hard to group the data depending on a DateTime field. For example if you want to group the data by month or by year, or even by day, it would be quite impossible. In order to bring this out of the box the RadChart provides you with a set of group descriptors that are capable to group the data via a DateTime field.
You have the following descriptors at your disposal:

  - ChartSecondGroupDescriptor
  - ChartMinuteGroupDescriptor
  - ChartHourGroupDescriptor
  - ChartDayGroupDescriptor
  - ChartMonthGroupDescriptor
  - ChartYearGroupDescriptor
