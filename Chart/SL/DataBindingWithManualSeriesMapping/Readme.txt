Besides the automatic series mapping, RadChart supports manual series mapping where you have full control on how the data is bound to the chart. The manual series mapping offers the following:

  - You can explicitly define which data field from the underlying data source to be bound to which data point member.
  - To set labels of the chart series.
  - To bind to nested collections.
  - To create categorical charts.
