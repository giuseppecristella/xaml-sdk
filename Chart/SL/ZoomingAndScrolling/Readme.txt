Sometimes, when having a large sets of data, they are hard to visualize, because the points have to be rendered in space greater than what is available for the RadChart. In this case you can use not only the Sampling feature of the RadChart, but Zooming and Scrolling as well.

Note: This feature is available in data bound scenarios only! Additional requirement is an ItemMapping with DataPointMember set to XValue or XCategory.
